# Problem Statement

## Title

Design and Implementation of an Automated Student Marks and Grade Management System

---

## 1. Context & Background

In educational environments, managing student academic records manually using paper registers or simple spreadsheets is inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Manual calculation of class statistics—such as individual letter grades or class averages—increases administrative workload and leads to inconsistency in evaluation.

## 2. Problem Definition

Currently, there is a lack of a lightweight, interactive system that can easily track student scores, convert numeric marks into standard letter grades, and perform fundamental administrative operations in a centralized location.

The primary challenges include:

* **Calculation Errors:** High probability of mistakes when manually calculating letter grades and class overall averages.
* **Data Integrity Issues:** Risk of accepting out-of-range marks (e.g., negative numbers or scores above 100).
* **Inefficient Data Access:** Difficulty in quickly looking up, updating, or deleting specific student records without sifting through complete lists.
* **Lack of Feedback:** Inability to instantly view class-wide performance metrics to assess overall academic output.

## 3. Objective

To design, develop, and deploy a CLI-based menu-driven Python application that automates student record management.

The system must satisfy the following functional requirements:

1. **Record Maintenance:** Allow administrators to add, update, delete, and view individual or complete student performance records.
2. **Grade Mapping:** Automatically convert raw scores (out of 100) into standardized letter grades (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`).
3. **Data Validation:** Enforce score boundary constraints ($0 \le \text{marks} \le 100$) before modifying data structures.
4. **Performance Analytics:** Aggregate overall class data to evaluate class-wide averages and average grade performance dynamically.
